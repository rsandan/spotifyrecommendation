Final project for DATA144: Data Mining (UC Berkeley)
# Predicting Song Suggestions Based on Track Metrics
- Can we accurately predict suggested songs following a playlist, based on the characteristics of a song?
- Being able to predict songs that have a similar "vibe" can boost creative input, as well as an eclectic music taste
- Ability to "blend" any number of user's songs to recommend tracks that have the highest similarity across all user songs'.
